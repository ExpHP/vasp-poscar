# Notably, the symbols line cannot have a comment (because ALL tokens are
# taken as symbols), while the counts line has a comment which begins at
# the first token that cannot be parsed as an integer.
#
# Comments on position data lines are sometimes used to store metadata.
# (e.g. pymatgen puts symbols there)
